# Infix Expression Calculator
This was a homework assignment I did in my Abstract Data Structures class.
It was a very fun project.  

## Entry Point
If you want to try it out, there is an interactive tester called Tester.java.

## Examples
This program uses the stack data structure to solve infix expressions.  
Examples include:
* 2 + 5
* (3^2-3+5) = 11
* 2 * (2 + 4) = 12
* [2 + 43] * 2 = 90
* ([2 + 43] * 2) / 2 = 45
* 18 % 2 = 0
* 5 % 2 = 1

## Main Take Away
I had written so many tests for this assignment.  It was not until afterwards 
that I learned about Junit.  This assignment showed me just how useful and 
powerful Junit is.  I wish I had known about it before hand.
